# Working rules for study/

## Order

- Arrange the material so that it can be read from the top. Do not use a term that no earlier section or note has explained.
- Start each note with a "Prerequisites" table that says which terms of earlier notes it uses.
- End each note with two tables: "Where this repository uses it" (README section, notes/ section, Lean file) and "Lean correspondence" (concept, Lean name, file).

## Content

- Write the definition first, then a small example.
- Give a proof or a proof outline for each theorem. Say so when something is not proved in Lean.
- Match what the Lean code actually does. Name the Lean declarations.
- When example values are computed, say how (for example with `#eval`, or by hand).
- Where the mathematics is the same as in the 1-Y version (study/ of [koteitan/1y-wo-por](https://github.com/koteitan/1y-wo-por)), keep the same order. Use the definitions and names of this repository.

## Sentences

- Write short sentences, one point per sentence.
- Do not use metaphors. Use literal words.
- Write in formulas what can be written in formulas.

## Formulas (so that GitHub renders them)

- Write inline math as `` $`...`$ ``.
- Write display math in a ```` ```math ```` fence.
- In inline math write the inequality signs as `\lt` and `\gt`.
- Break rows with `\cr`. Do not use two backslashes.
- Inside a list item, do not use a math fence. Use inline math only.
- Do not write `|` in math inside a table cell. Use `\mid`.

## References to other projects

- Refer to other projects by their public GitHub URL. Do not write local paths.
